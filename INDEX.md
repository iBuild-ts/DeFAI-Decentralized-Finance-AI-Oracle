## 💡 Key Concepts Quick Summary

### The Problem
- Memecoin trading is sentiment-driven but traders have no trustworthy sentiment data
- Existing oracles (Chainlink, Pyth) only provide price data
- Information asymmetry favors insiders

### The Solution
A decentralized oracle network that:
1. Scrapes X/TikTok in real-time
2. Analyzes sentiment with AI
3. Aggregates across oracle nodes
4. Publishes on-chain for smart contracts

### The Market
- Base memecoin trading: $2-5B+ daily
- Target users: Trading bots, DEXs, traders, protocols
- Revenue: Query fees, subscriptions, token listing, revenue sharing

### The Timeline
- **Week 1-4:** MVP on testnet
- **Week 5-8:** Mainnet launch
- **Week 9-12:** Ecosystem integration
- **Month 4+:** Scale and expansion
