## 🎯 The One-Minute Summary

**DeFAI Oracle** is a decentralized, real-time sentiment oracle for Base memecoins.

**Problem:** Memecoin traders have no trustworthy way to measure sentiment, even though sentiment drives 100% of memecoin value.

**Solution:** A Chainlink-style oracle network that:
- Scrapes X/TikTok in real-time
- Analyzes sentiment with AI
- Aggregates across decentralized nodes
- Publishes sentiment scores on-chain

**Market:** Base memecoin trading = $2-5B+ daily. Even 1% adoption = huge revenue.

**Timeline:** 
- Week 1-4: MVP on testnet
- Week 5-8: Mainnet launch
- Week 9-12: Ecosystem integration
- Month 4+: Scale

**Revenue:** Query fees + subscriptions + token listing + revenue sharing

**Competitive Advantage:** We're the ONLY decentralized sentiment oracle for memecoins. Chainlink and Pyth only do price.
